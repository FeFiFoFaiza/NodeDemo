# NodeDemo

am so sorry diana

ideas:
- make real time chat application using node library like socket.io
- attempt to make agar.io using socket.io
- multiplayer game like battleships
- an email sender


Decided to go with the real time chat app

This real time chat app uses Socket.io and Express (which is a Node.js framework for building web based applications.
